The project uses the supervised text classification tools and machine learning methods to predict movie genres based on their movie descriptions. The movies and their corresponding data which is the plot summaries, the titles and genres will be taken from TMDB with over 10 000 movie data. As a movie can belong to several genres, this project will use the multi label classification. The main aim is to process natural languages, therefore only the movie descriptions will be used. Since movies are all over the internet and they are attracting a large portion of the population, it is with great importance that the information found about a movie which is mostly the plot summaries can be used to predict the genre of a movie. This will be achieved by text classification and machine learning techniques. We will also be including the emotions each plot carries to help with the predictions. Movie genres are associated with emotions like for horror there is fear.
