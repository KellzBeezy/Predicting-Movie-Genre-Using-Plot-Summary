OVERVIEW:	Marion is a woman who has learned to shield herself from her emotions. She rents an apartment to work undisturbed on her new book, but by some acoustic anomaly she can hear all that is said in the next apartment in which a psychiatrist holds his office.

After a series of events she comes to understand how her unemotional attitude towards the people around her affected them and herself.
