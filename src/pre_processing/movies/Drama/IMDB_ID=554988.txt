TITLE:	Before Tomorrow

OVERVIEW:	Wagner is a cop, a man who doesn't talk much, unlike Zippolt, the guy he has to sit in the car with. Both men are ordered to give close protection to Siegfried, a suspected murderer. Wagner lives in an old fashioned apartment, he counts birds, listens to Richard Wagner's operas, sees a lot, does little, meets a woman, gets entangled - and in the end he loses his countenance. A story about good-wanting and wrong-doing, about relationships and people in contemporary Berlin.
