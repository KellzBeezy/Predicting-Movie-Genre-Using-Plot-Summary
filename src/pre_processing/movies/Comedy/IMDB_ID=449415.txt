TITLE:	Classe Z

OVERVIEW:	First day of last year for the students of a high school science, but at school there is something new: some guys have been moved from their respective classes in a section created especially for them, the section H. Students of the H section are not were chosen at random, are in fact notoriously problematic elements, too exuberant and listless. Among them is Ricky (Enrico Oetiker) who is awake and never misses a chance to make jokes irritating that it shares on its Youtube channel, Star (Greta Menchi) whose only interest is its look and Viola (Alice Pagani) intelligent but always at war with the world.
