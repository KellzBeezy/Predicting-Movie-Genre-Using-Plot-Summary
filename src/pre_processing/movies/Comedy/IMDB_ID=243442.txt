TITLE:	Un fantastico via vai

OVERVIEW:	Arnaldo, Anita and the twins, Martina and Federica, here is the Nardi family. A quiet, normal middle class family. The man is at that stage of his life where nostalgia for the period as a student becomes stronger. It would be nice to be able to go back. It would be nice to savor those moments. It would be also nice to tell someone who has little more than twenty years in life you have to believe in their dreams and not be afraid...
