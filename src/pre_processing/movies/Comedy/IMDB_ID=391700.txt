TITLE:	We Are Family

OVERVIEW:	Thirteen-year-old Bastien is the center of a reconstructed family: 6 half-brothers and sisters, 8 "parents," and as many houses. His tasks within the family are far more complex than what he has to do at school.  But enough's enough: the children decide to wage a revolution and turn the rules upside down. All together, the squat a large apartment and now it'll be up to the parents to come to them!
