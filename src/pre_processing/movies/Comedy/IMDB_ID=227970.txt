TITLE:	Men Are From Mars... And That’s Where I’m Going!

OVERVIEW:	Successful at work, Fernanda is an example of women of the third millennium, free to make their choices and independent. Yet in her personal life she finds herself struggling to find a husband. Like other women of her generation, Fernanda put her personal life on hold to devote herself to her career and now suddenly feels her love life situation has become an emergency.  Being single at 39 is quite different from being single at 29, after all "the fertile egg has an expiration date"!
