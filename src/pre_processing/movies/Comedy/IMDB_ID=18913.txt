OVERVIEW:	Offbeat fashion student Betsy Hopper and her straight-laced investment-banker fianc√©, Dylan Walsh, just want an intimate little wedding reception, but Betsy's father, Eddie, a Long Island construction contractor, feels so threatened by Jake's rich WASP parents that he blows the ceremony up into a bank-breaking showpiece, sending his wife, Lola, into a financial panic.
