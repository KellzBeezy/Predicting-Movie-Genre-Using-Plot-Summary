TITLE:	My Favorite Shapes by Julio Torres

OVERVIEW:	In this multimedia comedy show, Torres explores his favorite shapes, which include a plexiglass square, a triangle, an oval that wishes he were a circle, a self-conscious cactus and a Ferrero Rocher chocolate that Julio is mad at because she left her little skirt at home. The objects are presented via an industrial conveyer belt and serve as a jumping-off point for fantastical stories, anecdotes and jokes.
