TITLE:	The Hot Flashes

OVERVIEW:	An unlikely basketball team of unappreciated middle-aged Texas women, all former high school champs, challenge the current high school girlsâ€™ state champs to raise money for breast cancer prevention. Sparks fly as the women go to comic extremes to prove themselves on and off the court, become a national media sensation, and gain a new lease on life.
