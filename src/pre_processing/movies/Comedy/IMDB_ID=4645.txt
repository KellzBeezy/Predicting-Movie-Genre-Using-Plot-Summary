TITLE:	Ã–dipussi

OVERVIEW:	Paul Winkelmann (Loriot) is the CEO of a successful business in Hamburg that he took over after the death of his father eight years ago. But he is still strongly dominated by his 78 year old mother who cares for him as a child, and who cannot understand why he took an apartment on his own after all these years. The real "problem" starts when Paul gets to know psychologist Margarethe Tietze (Evelyn Hamann) whose relationship to her parents is also not so easy after all.
