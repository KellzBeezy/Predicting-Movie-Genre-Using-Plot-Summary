TITLE:	The Producers

OVERVIEW:	Broadway producer, Max Bialystock and his accountant, Leo Bloom plan to make money by charming little old ladies to invest in a production many times over what it will actually cost, and then put on a sure-fire flop, so nobody will ask for their money back â€“ and what can be a more certain flop than a tasteless musical celebrating Hitler.
