TITLE:	Brain Drain

OVERVIEW:	Emilio, a shy, not too brilliant pupil at a humble local secondary school, has always harboured a secret love for Natalia, the cutest, brightest girl in the class. On the last day of the school year, when he finally decides to declare his love, Natalia is awarded a scholarship to study Medicine at Oxford. It would seem that all is lost for Emilio, but his drop-out school-pals are not ready to throw in the towel. After faking qualifications and scholarships, this band of brainless nuts land in Oxford, causing havoc in the normally peaceful campus existence.  â€”The Film Catalogue
