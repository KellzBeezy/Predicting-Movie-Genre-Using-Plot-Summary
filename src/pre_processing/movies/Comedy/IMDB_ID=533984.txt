TITLE:	Get Her... If You Can

OVERVIEW:	Roberto (Rey) and Daniela (Salamanca) are two brothers who live in a world of wealth and glamor thanks to the shipping company they inherited from their father. Both share the direction of the company, although they have a completely opposite attitude to life: Daniela is thorough and perfectionist; Roberto, on the other hand, is a visionary genius who hates the meticulousness of his sister. However, both find the way out of their disagreements when they fall in love with the same woman: Isabel (Dolera), a monologist who Roberto has hired to seduce Daniela and so be as fun as she was before taking the address of the company.
