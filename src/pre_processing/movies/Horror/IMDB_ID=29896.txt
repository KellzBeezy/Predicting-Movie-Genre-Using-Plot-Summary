TITLE:	Never Cry Werewolf

OVERVIEW:	Teenager Loren (Nina Dobrev) doesn't like her new neighbor, Jared (Peter Stebbings), or his vicious dog. Along with her friend Steven (Sean O'Neill), Loren spies on Jared and begins to suspect he's a werewolf, responsible for a rash of disappearances. But Jared is watching her just as closely, because Loren reminds him of his dead wife. As a full-moon night nears, Loren enlists the help of TV star Redd Tucker (Kevin Sorbo), who knows how to hunt -- and who believes her werewolf theory.
