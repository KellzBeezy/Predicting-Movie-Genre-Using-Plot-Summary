TITLE:	City of the Living Dead

OVERVIEW:	A medium has a mysterious vision of a priest hanging himself...  A seemingly dead woman awakes screaming in her coffin...  And in the sleepy New England town of Dunwich, a girl vomits up her intestines and a local misfit has a drill bit ploughed into his cranium...  These hallucionogenic often grotesque visions punctuate a skeletal story telling of a reporter and a psychic who must race against time to prevent hordes of rotting corpses spewing forth from the gates of hell...
