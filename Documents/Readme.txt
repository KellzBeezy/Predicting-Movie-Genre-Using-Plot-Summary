ABSTRACT:

The project uses the supervised text classification tools and 
machine learning methods to predict movie genres based on their movie descriptions. 
The movies and their corresponding data will be taken from TMDB with over 10 000 movie data.
As a movie can belong to several genres, this project will use the multi 
label classification. The main aim is to process natural languages, 
therefore only the movie descriptions will be used.
